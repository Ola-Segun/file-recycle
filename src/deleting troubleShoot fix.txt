can you confirm the flow and the data from the file selection to the deleting of the files after confirming delete . And check if it is correct , try as much as possible to get the proccess well and point anywhere that has problems

Let me trace the complete flow and data structure at each step:
1. File Selection (in fileManGrid.vue or fileManList.vue):

// When checkbox is clicked
handelFileDetails = (name, index, file) => {
  if (name === "fileDelete") {
    file.isSelected = !file.isSelected;
    currentPopupFileDetails.value.push(file);
  }
  sendDataToParent(); // Emits to FilesManCard
}

2. FilesManCard receives selection:

handelDataFromFileManGrid = (data1, data2) => {
  if (data1.value === "fileDelete") {
    currentPopupFileDetails.value = data2;
    currentFilesLength.value = data2.length;
  }
}



3. Opening Delete Modal:

// In FilesManCard
handelDataDeletePopup = (name) => {
  if (currentFilesLength.value > 0) {
    currentPopup.value = name;
    sendToParent(); // Emits to FilemanView
  }
}

4. FilemanView shows delete modal:

handelDataFromFilesManCard = (popupName, fileData) => {
  popupDisplayName.value = popupName;
  popupFileData.value = Array.isArray(fileData) ? fileData : [fileData];
}



5. Confirm Delete (in fileDeleteCard.vue):

confirmDelete = () => {
  emit("send-to-parent", { value: "confirmDelete" }, { value: selectedFiles.value });
}



6. FilemanView handles confirmation:

handleDeleteConfirmed = (data1, data2) => {
  filesToDelete.value = data2.value;
  popupDisplayName.value = 'none';
}

Potential Issues I See:

1. In fileDeleteCard.vue, the confirmation is using send-to-parent event but also has a deleteConfirmed emit defined that's not being used.

2. The data structure changes through the flow:
 . Initially: Direct file objects
 . Then: Wrapped in { value: files }
 . Finally: Needs to be unwrapped for deletion

3. The confirmation path seems indirect:

   fileDeleteCard -> FilemanView -> FilesManCard (via prop) -> watch


Instead of:

   fileDeleteCard -> FilemanView -> FilesManCard (via direct event)


Would you like me to propose specific fixes for any of these issues?
yes


Looking at the flow, I can see several issues:
1. In fileDeleteCard.vue, we're using the wrong emit event:

// Current:
const confirmDelete = () => {
  emit("send-to-parent", { value: "confirmDelete" }, { value: selectedFiles.value });
}

// Should be:
const confirmDelete = () => {
  console.log('FileDeleteCard - Confirming delete with files:', selectedFiles.value);
  emit("deleteConfirmed", { value: "confirmDelete" }, { value: selectedFiles.value });
}


2. In FilemanView.vue, we have both events but only one is being used properly:

<FileDeleteCard
  :currentDisplay="popupDisplayName"
  :currentDisplayFileData="popupFileData"
  @send-to-parent="detailsCardMessage"     // This handles modal closing
  @deleteConfirmed="handleDeleteConfirmed"  // This should handle the delete confirmation
/>


3. The data flow should be:

fileDeleteCard (emit "deleteConfirmed") 
-> FilemanView (handleDeleteConfirmed updates filesToDelete) 
-> FilesManCard (watches itemsTodelete prop)


4. The watch in FilesManCard is getting triggered because filesToDelete is being updated in FilemanView, but the data structure might be wrong. Let's fix handleDeleteConfirmed in FilemanView:

const handleDeleteConfirmed = (data1, data2) => {
  console.log('FilemanView - Handling delete confirmation:', {
    data1,
    data2,
    files: data2.value
  });
  // Update filesToDelete with the correct data structure
  filesToDelete.value = data2.value;
  popupDisplayName.value = 'none';
}



Would you like me to show the complete fixed versions of these files?
yes and apply

I see the issue now. Let's fix the flow by updating these files:
First, fix fileDeleteCard.vue to use the correct emit:
Update FilemanView.vue to properly handle the confirmation:
In FilesManCard.vue, the watch and handler are correct, but let's add more logging:
The flow should now be:
User clicks Delete in modal -> confirmDelete() in fileDeleteCard
fileDeleteCard emits "deleteConfirmed" -> handled by handleDeleteConfirmed in FilemanView
FilemanView updates filesToDelete -> triggers watch in FilesManCard
FilesManCard processes the deletion through handleDeleteFiles
Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part in more detail.
